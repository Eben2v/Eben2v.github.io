                        We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Yes, Yes, without the oops! This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

                    Life finds a way. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. What do they got in there? King Kong? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
